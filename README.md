# Twilio Pay Outbound Example

This demo shows how to collect payment information by placing an outbound call to a customer and using [Twilio Pay](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/pay).

_NOTE: The payment method collection flow is not fully built out. After providing fake credit card information, it will simply fail. You will need to implement your payment processing flow to use something like this in production._
